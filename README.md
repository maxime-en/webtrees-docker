# Docker Image for [webtrees](https://webtrees.net/) from [NathanVaughn/webtrees-docker](https://github.com/NathanVaughn/webtrees-docker)

This docker image is very close to the NathanVaughn's one, apart from that
it can be executed without root rights (user option for instance).
Even if you start without the docker user option, the Dockerfile enforces
starting the application using a non-privileged user with the USER directive.

The NathanVaughn's docker image is multi-arch and can be executed standalone,
managing the SSL layer if required. This fork removes a lot of features not
useful from my side, for example the SSL layer is handled by a reverse
proxy. It also removes support for other database systems than mysql/mariadb.

## Usage

### Quickstart

No pre-built image is provided.
You can build the docker image easily by cloning the repository
and building from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxime-en/webtrees-docker.git
make
```

You will require the following dependancies:

* make
* curl
* docker
* docker buildx plugin

A [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/maxime-en/webtrees-docker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) example file is provided.

### Environment Variables

There are many environment variables available to help automatically configure
the container. For any environment variable you do not define,
the default value will be used.

> **ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨**
> These environment variables will be visible in the webtrees control panel
> under "Server information". Either lock down the control panel
> to administrators, or use the webtrees setup wizard.

Additionally, you can add `_FILE` to the end of any environment variable name,
and instead that will read the value in from the given filename.
For example, setting `DB_PASS_FILE=/run/secrets/my_db_secret` will read the contents
of that file into `DB_PASS`.

If you don't want the container to be configured automatically
(if you're migrating from an existing webtrees installation for example), simply leave
the database (`DB_`) and webtrees (`WT_`) variables blank, and you can complete the
[setup wizard](https://i.imgur.com/rw70cgW.png) like normal.

### Database

webtrees [recommends](https://webtrees.net/install/requirements/)
a MySQL (or compatible equivalent) database.
You will need a separate container for this.

- [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)
- [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)

### Volumes

The image mounts:

- `/var/www/webtrees/data/`

(media is stored in the `media` subfolder)

If you want to add custom [themes or modules](https://webtrees.net/download/modules),
you can also mount the `/var/www/webtrees/modules_v4/` directory.

Example `docker-compose`:

```yml
volumes:
  - app_data:/var/www/webtrees/data/
  - app_themes:/var/www/webtrees/modules_v4/
---
volumes:
  app_data:
    driver: local
  app_themes:
    driver: local
```

### Network

The image exposes port 8080.

Example `docker-compose`:

```yml
ports:
  - 8080:8080
```

### ImageMagick

`ImageMagick` is included in this image to speed up
[thumbnail creation](https://webtrees.net/faq/thumbnails/).
webtrees will automatically prefer it over `gd` with no configuration.
